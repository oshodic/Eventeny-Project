      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Foodventeny is a seasoned local festival organization that has been organizing a Memorial Day food truck
          festival for about 5 years now, and we are starting to pick up momentum! Attendance has increased year

          We are excited to see our loyal vendors this year, as well as welcome new ones! You can find all the
          information on applying to be a vendor below.
